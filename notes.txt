Key Concepts
Unidirectional Mapping: Only one entity (the "one" side) knows about the relationship.
Bidirectional Mapping: Both entities (the "one" and "many" sides) are aware of the relationship.

Use @OneToMany in the parent entity to define the relationship.
Use @ManyToOne in the child entity to establish the link back to the parent.
The mappedBy attribute in @OneToMany indicates the field in the child entity that owns the relationship.

CascadeType.ALL ensures that child entities are persisted or deleted along with the parent.
mappedBy avoids creating an additional join table by specifying the owning side of the relationship.
Use @JoinColumn to customize the foreign key column name in the child table.





A one-to-many relationship between two entities
is defined using the @OneToMany annotation in
Spring Data JPA. It declares the mappedBy
element to indicate the entity that owns the
bidirectional relationship.
Usually, the child entity owns the relationship,
and the parent entity contains the @OneToMany
annotation.

-------------------------------------------
Bidirectional mapping with @12M and @M21
@12M would be placed on a collection association of an entity (or the One side) with the
mapped by attribute pointing to the relationship owner
@Entity
public class Book{
@OneToMany(mappedBy="book", cascade=CascadeType.ALL)
private Set<Page> pages = new HashSet<>();
}
@Entity
public class Page{
@ManyToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY, optional=false)
@JoinColumn(name="book_id")
private Book book;

}
@ManyToOne would be placed on the single item association of an entity
 (or the relationship owner; the table with a foreign key column in the underlying database)
@JoinColumn specifies the foreign key column.
It is optional for bi-drectional mapping,
default name to the underscore string join of the association field name and its
primary key column name

 On the opposite, the mappedBy attribute on @OneToMany is required to
  specify for bi-drectional mapping. If mappedBy is absent,  JPA and Hibernate
  will create a redundant join table book_pages
 +------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field      | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| book_id | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| pages_id   | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
+------------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+

 Both entities of the relationship can quickly access and cascade CRUD operations to
 each other

 Unidirecrional mapping with @ManyToOne
 This annotation would be placed on a single item association of an
 entity (on on the table with a foreign key column in the underlying database).
 There is no child collection association mapping on the parent entity
